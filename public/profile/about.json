    "about": "I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Stony Brook University, expected to graduate in December 2025. I have a robust professional background, having worked as a Data Scientist at Ford Motor Company from February 2021 to January 2024, and previously as a Software Engineer at CenturyLink and UST Global. During my tenure at Ford Motor Company, I designed and developed innovative solutions using large language models (LLMs) to streamline compliance validation, forecast employee attrition, and automate topic identification in large datasets. I also created analytical BI dashboards and developed machine learning models that significantly reduced manual efforts and saved costs for the company. At CenturyLink, I implemented web applications, developed new ticketing flows, and designed data pipelines to ingest large volumes of data. At UST Global, I migrated web services to GraphQL APIs, built user dashboards, and created RESTful endpoints, all contributing to enhanced performance and user experience. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Kuppam Engineering College, India, where I graduated with a gold medal for finishing in the top 1% of my class. My technical skills include Python, Java, Angular, SQL, Google BigQuery, and various machine learning and cloud technologies. I have been recognized for my contributions with several awards, including the Asia Pacific Recognition at Ford and the Execution Mindset award at UST Global. I am passionate about continuous learning and development, having hosted weekly sessions to coach teams on Python and Google Cloud tools. In addition to my professional pursuits, I enjoy cycling, walking and travelling.",
